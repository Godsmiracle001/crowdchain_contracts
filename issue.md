Overview
This issue outlines the implementation of the campaign management functionality for Crowdchain. The goal is to create a robust contract for managing campaigns with features for approved creator validations, campaign lifecycle management (active, completed, paused, etc.), statistical tracking, and administrative controls.

Requirements
Campaign Creation: Only approved creators should be able to create new campaigns.
Campaign Status Tracking: Maintain statuses such as active, completed, paused, etc. to monitor the campaign lifecycle.
Administrative Controls: Provide functionality for admins to pause/unpause campaigns when needed.
Campaign Statistics: Track various statistics associated with campaigns, such as the number of supporters.
Top Performing Campaigns: Identify and highlight the campaigns with the highest number of supporters.
Files to Create/Modify
src/interfaces/ICampaign.cairo - Define the campaign interface.
src/contracts/Campaign.cairo - Implement the campaign management logic.
src/events/CampaignEvent.cairo - Emit events related to campaign actions and updates.
tests/test_campaign.cairo - Write tests to cover the campaign functionality.
Testing Requirements
Test campaign creation ensuring only approved creators can create campaigns.
Test campaign updates and status transitions (active, pausing/unpausing, completed, etc.).
Test administrative pause/unpause functionality.
Verify campaign statistics tracking.
Validate logic for identifying top performing campaigns.
Technical Considerations
Built for Starknet using Cairo, aligning with the project's existing implementations.
Follow security best practices similar to those outlined in the Crowdchain README ensuring proper access control and error handling.
Definition of Done âœ…

Campaign contract implemented and integrated with the system.

Interface and event modules for campaign management are created.

All related tests passing (campaign creation, updating, pausing/unpausing, statistics tracking).

Documentation updated accordingly.
This implementation will enhance the system's capabilities in managing decentralized campaigns while providing robustness and transparency in its operations. ðŸš€
